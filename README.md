# Next-Word-Prediction-Model

This repository contains the Python implementation of a Next Word Prediction (NWP) Model. The NWP Model is a natural language processing (NLP) based application that predicts the next word in a sequence of words, given the preceding context. The model is built using Python and leverages deep learning techniques to achieve accurate predictions.

# Introduction

Next Word Prediction means predicting the most likely word or phrase that will come next in a sentence or text. It is like having an inbuilt feature on an application that suggests the next word as you type or speak. The Next Word Prediction Models are used in applications like messaging apps, search engines, virtual assistants, and autocorrect features on smartphones. So, if you want to learn how to build a Next Word Prediction Model, this article is for you. In this article, Iâ€™ll take you through building a Next Word Prediction Model with Deep Learning using Python.

# What is the Next Word Prediction Model & How to Build it?
Next word prediction is a language modelling task in Machine Learning that aims to predict the most probable word or sequence of words that follows a given input context. This task utilizes statistical patterns and linguistic structures to generate accurate predictions based on the context provided.

 For example, when you start typing a message on your phone, it suggests the next word to speed up your typing. Similarly, search engines predict and show search suggestions as you type in the search bar. Next word prediction helps us communicate faster and more accurately by anticipating what we might say or search for.

To build a Next Word Prediction model:

1)start by collecting a diverse dataset of text documents,

2)preprocess the data by cleaning and tokenizing it, 

3)prepare the data by creating input-output pairs, 

4)engineer features such as word embeddings, 

5)select an appropriate model like an LSTM or GPT, 

6)train the model on the dataset while adjusting hyperparameters,

7)improve the model by experimenting with different techniques and architectures.

8)This iterative process allows businesses to develop accurate and efficient Next Word Prediction models that can be applied in various applications.

# Installation:
 
To install the necessary dependencies, you can use the following pip commands:

            pip install tensorflow numpy scikit-learn
                           or
            pip install torch numpy scikit-learn

# Usage:

To use the Next Word Prediction Model, follow these steps:

Import the necessary libraries and modules.

Load the pre-trained model (or train a new model using your dataset).

Preprocess the input text or sequence of words.

Use the model to predict the next word.

# Model Architecture
The Next Word Prediction Model can be built using different architectures. Some common approaches include:

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): LSTMs or GRUs.

Transformer-based models: GPT, BERT, etc.

For this implementation, we have used a simple LSTM-based architecture.

# Dataset
To train the Next Word Prediction Model, you'll need a large dataset of text in the language of interest. Commonly used datasets include Wikipedia dumps, books, news articles, or any other text corpus.

#  Model Training
If you want to train your own model, follow these steps:

1)Prepare your dataset and split it into training and validation sets.

2)Preprocess the text data, including tokenization and converting words to numerical representations.

3)Build and train the Next Word Prediction Model using the chosen architecture (LSTM, Transformer, etc.).

4)Save the trained model for future use.

# Conclusion
Implementing a Next Word Prediction Model using Python can be a rewarding endeavor. By following the steps outlined in this README, you can build an efficient and accurate NWP Model capable of generating contextually relevant predictions.
